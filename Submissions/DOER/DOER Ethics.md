While various datasets may be used in this project, none possess any private or sensitive user information which may require prior approval. Additionally, whilst this project is user-centric, the project itself does not pose any potential to cause distress towards users. The potential to learn from users should not also be considered a breach of ethics as this learning would be based entirely on the user's interaction with the project, as opposed to any additional sources which may be seen as invasive.
