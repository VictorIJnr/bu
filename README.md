# <span style="color:#e3c59e">bu</span>
User-Centric Semi-Structured Natural Language Generation. I'm not naming this "improved-waddle" Github...

## Huh, looks like I neglected this README for a while
Anyway, I'm just here to explain the structure for this repo, since it's a lil' bit different to what I'd normally do. So, you see that little folder called [aibu](aibu/)? Yeah, that's where all the [source code](aibu/src) for this boi is kept. Well that and <span style="color:#e3c59e">**bu**</span>'s [Dockerfile](aibu/Dockerfile). Odd right? Well. Yeah. It is. BUT, I have a _"good"_ reason for it. Kinda. I'm essentially future-proofing this, because that's always a **_fantastic_** idea. I'm not sure whether I'll add [distbu](https://github.com/VictorIJnr/distbu) to this repo - well as much as you can have it as a sub-repo that is - because it would be easier to work with and debug with a cheeky lil' `docker-compose up -d --build` you know? But yeah, that's why we have this structure. Granted, I could decide that, even though they're both important to <span style="color:#e3c59e">**bu**</span>, I'll have them as separate repos. <span style="color:#333">distbu</span> could spin off to become their own thing for people to upload and pull datasets (because that would actually be incredibly useful) but for now, I don't know whether I'll leave them as separate repos (slightly like this option more) or put them into one big repo.
